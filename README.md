## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I recommend Betterment implement a financial educational platform, which provides courses, webinars etc to new investors to understand the basics of investing. 

 

 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

 

This would benefit the company through firstly raising customer engagment levels, but most importantly it would ensure that investors feel more encouraged to invest as they understand the basics and thus more likely to sign up to their platform.

 

 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise and Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

 

You would need the following technologies:

The firm would need to implement a learning management system where they can upload content.
Video conferencing software -> this would be used to hold webinars and information sessions
Interactive tools -> these would allow the users of the program to attain better education on how to invest.
